# Pokemon Party Builder v2

This is an updated version of my [very first coding project](https://github.com/smh1988-2/pokemon-party-builder). The original was built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. It has a local backend using json-server.

This version uses a React frontend, with Redux for state management and a Ruby on Rails backend (coming soon!).

Pokemon data is from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Learning goals
1. Learn and implement Redux in a real web app.
2. Build a mobile-first web app (the OG is **not** mobile-friendly).
3. Use SASS to style the app.

## User stories
1. I want to search the database for a Pokemon.
2. I want to to see that Pokemon and relevant information, including a picture.
3. I want to be able to add that Pokemon to my party and display my entire party (up to 6 Pokemon).
4. I want to see the stats, strengths, and weaknesses of every Pokemon in my party.
